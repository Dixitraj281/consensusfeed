      "description": "In this post, we share how Wipro implemented advanced prompt engineering techniques, custom validation logic, and automated code rectification to streamline the development of industrial automation code at scale using Amazon Bedrock. We walk through the architecture along with the key use cases, explain core components and workflows, and share real-world results that show the transformative impact on manufacturing operations.",
