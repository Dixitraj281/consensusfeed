      "content": "Earlier this year, we introduced Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Gateway, a fully managed service that serves as a centralized MCP tool server, providing a unified interface where agents can discover, access, and invoke tools. Today, we're extending support for existing MCP servers as a new target type in AgentCore Gateway. With this capability, you can group multiple task-specific MCP servers aligned to agent goals behind a single, manageable MCP gateway interface. This reduces the operational...",
