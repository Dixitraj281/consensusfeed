      "description": "In this post, we introduce Managed Tiered KV Cache and Intelligent Routing for Amazon SageMaker HyperPod, new capabilities that can reduce time to first token by up to 40% and lower compute costs by up to 25% for long context prompts and multi-turn conversations. These features automatically manage distributed KV caching infrastructure and intelligent request routing, making it easier to deploy production-scale LLM inference workloads with enterprise-grade performance while significantly...",
