We examine the technical limitations of traditional approaches and demonstrate how Amazon Nova Multimodal Embeddings enables retrieval across text, images, and other modalities. You learn how to implement a crossmodal search system by generating embeddings, handling queries, and measuring performance. We provide working code examples and share how...",
