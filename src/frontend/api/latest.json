We explore how the Union.ai 2.0 system enables deployment of Flyte on Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS), integrating seamlessly with AWS services like Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), Amazon Aurora, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM), and Amazon CloudWatch. We explore the solution through an AI workflow example, using the new Amazon S3 Vectors service.",
